# PHP CodeSniffer GitHub Action

This action will help you to run phpcs (PHP_CodeSniffer) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) platform. It also supports [annotations](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks#checks) out of the box â€” you don't need to use any tokens to make it work.
